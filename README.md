# Mini Projects (Set 2)
Level: Combined Concepts (state, conditional rendering, etc) 
—----------------------- 
1. To-Do List 
Build a basic to-do list app where users can add tasks, mark them as 
completed, and remove them. Use useState to manage the task list. 
2. Login Form 
Create a LoginForm component with email and password fields and a 
"Login" button. When submitted, display a "Welcome back!" message if 
both fields are filled correctly with email and password matching 
hardcoded values for each; otherwise, show an error message. 
3. News Feed Page 
Build a news feed page where a list of posts or articles is dynamically 
displayed. Each post should include a title, author, a short excerpt, and a 
"Read More" button. When the button is clicked, the full content of the 
post should appear. You can implement a search bar to filter posts by 
title or category. 
4. E-Commerce Products Page 
Create a product listing page for an e-commerce website. The page 
should display a list of products with each product showing an image, 
name, price, and short description. Include an "Add to Cart" button for 
each product. Use props to dynamically pass product data, and 
implement conditional rendering to show "In Stock" or "Out of Stock" 
labels.
